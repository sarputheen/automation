Generate SSH Key in Windows:  
https://inchoo.net/dev-talk/how-to-generate-ssh-keys-for-git-authorization/
Windows
Just follow these 5 steps:

Go to this address, and download Git for Windows, after the download install it with default settings
Open Git Bash that you just installed (Start->All Programs->Git->Git Bash)
Type in the following: ssh-keygen -t rsa (when prompted, enter password, key name can stay the same)
Open file your_home_directory/.ssh/id_rsa.pub with your favorite text editor, and copy contents to your Git repository’s keys field (GitHub, beanstalk, or any other repository provider), under your account.
Be sure that you don’t copy any whitespace while copying public key’s content (id_rsa.pub)
Note: your_home_directory is either C:\Users\your_username (on Windows Vista / 7 / 8 / 10), or C:\Documents and Settings\your_username (on Windows XP)
